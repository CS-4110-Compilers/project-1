# Project 2 
implement a lexical analyzer for a simple object-oriented programming language called Toy. Your program should be able to (1) translate any input Toy program into a sequence of tokens, and (2) create a symbol table using the trie structure for all keywords and user-defined identifiers.

# Software
To runs this program, python 3.x is required. PLY version 3.11 libraries, yacc and lex were added to the project folder.

# How to Run
1. Open Project Folder 
2. To input test code open toy_program.txt paste or type test code and save
3. Run parser.py

# If Using IDLE 
Right click parser.py then click Run -> Run Module 

# If Using PyCharm 
Click on Green Arrow

# If using Terminal 
cd into project directory and then run 'python3 parser.py'

# For any other IDE's 
Please refer to the user manual for your specific IDE. In most cases you can run parser.py via selection menu for project 

# Output files
'output.csv' will be generated showing the parsing actions for the given input in toy_program.txt. The file can be opened in any spreadsheet reader such as excel, numbers, google sheets etc. Or via notepad (windows) or TextEdit (MacOS). 'parser.out' will also be generated containing the tables used for parsing. All other output files can be ignored. All files will be generated in the same directory in which parser.py is located.
